# edgar-engine
Collect EDGAR company filings and inject them to persistent storage as machine readable data

1. Boot up your local Mongo server (localhost:27017)
    * Will be configurable later :)
2. Run com.edgarengine.service.HaidesServer
    * Barely a stub right now. Will become a cigar later on. Hopefully.
3. It's gonna take couple of days to collect all the data. Enjoy!
